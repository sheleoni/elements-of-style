            Do not construct awkward adverbs

            <p>Adverbs are easy to build. 
                Take an adjective or a participle, add <i>-ly</i>, and behold! you have an adverb. 
                But you'd probably be better off without it. 
                Do not write <i>tangledly</i>. 
                The word itself is a tangle. 
                Do not even write <i>tiredly</i>.
                Nobody says <i>tangledly</i> and not many people say <i>tiredly</i>. Words that are not used orally are seldom the ones to put on paper.

            <table>
                <tr><td>*</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>He climbed tiredly to bed.</td><td>He climbed wearily to bed.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>The lamp cord lay tangledly beneath her chair.</td><td>The lamp cord lay in tangles beneath her chair.</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>Do not dress words up by adding <i>-ly</i> to them, as though putting a hat on a horse.</p>

            <table>

                <tr><td>*</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>overly</td><td>over</td></tr>
                <tr><td>muchly</td><td>much</td></tr>
                <tr><td>thusly</td><td>thus</td></tr>
