            Do not use dialect unless your ear is good.

            <p>Do not attempt to use dialect unless you are a devoted student of the tongue you hope to reproduce. If you use dialect, be consistent. 
                The reader will become impatient or confused upon finding two or more versions of the same word or expression. 
                In dialect it is necessary to spell phonetically, or at least ingeniously, to capture unusual inflections. 
                Take, for example, the word <i>once</i>. It often appears in dialect writing as <i>oncet</i>, but <i>oncet</i> looks as though it should be pronounced "onset." 
                A better spelling would be <i>wunst</i>. But if you write it <i>oncet</i> once, write it that way throughout. 
                The best dialect writers, by and large, are economical of their talents; 
                they use the minimum, not the maximum, of deviation from the norm, thus sparing their readers as well as convincing them.</p>
