            <p>This principle, that of parallel construction, requires that expressions similar in content and function be outwardly similar. The likeness of form enables the reader to recognize more readily the likeness of content and function. The familiar Beatitudes exemplify the virtue of parallel construction.
            
            <p><b>
                Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</b></p>
            <p><b>Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</b></p>
            <p><b>Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</b></p>
            <p><b>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.</b></p>

            <p>The unskilled writer often violates this principle, mistakenly believing in the value of constantly varying the form of expression. When repeating a statement to emphasize it, the writer may need to vary its form. Otherwise, the writer should follow the principle of parallel construction.</p>

            <table>
                <tr><td>*</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method, while now the laboratory method is employed.</td>
                    <td>Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method; now it is taught by the laboratory method.</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>The lefthand version gives the impression that the writer is undecided or timid, apparently unable or afraid to choose one form of expression and hold to it. The righthand version shows that the writer has at least made a choice and abided by it.</p>
            <p>By this principle, an article or a preposition applying to all the members of a series must either be used only before the first term or else be repeated before each term.</p>
            
            <table>
                <tr><td>*</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>the French, the Italians, Spanish, and Portuguese</td>
                    <td>the French, the Italians, the Spanish, and the Portuguese</td></tr>

                <tr><td>in spring, summer</td>
                <td>in spring, summer, or winter (in spring, in summer, or in winter)</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>Some words require a particular preposition in certain idiomatic uses. When such words are joined in a compound construction, all the appropriate prepositions must be included, unless they are the same.</p>

            <table>
                <tr><td>*</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>His speech was marked by disagreement and scorn for his opponent's position.</td>
                    <td>His speech was marked by disagreement with and scorn for his opponent's position.</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>Correlative expressions (<i>both, and; not, but; not only, but also; either, or; first, second, third;</i> and the like) 
                should be followed by the same grammatical construction. Many violations of this rule can be corrected by rearranging the sentence.</p>
                   
            <table>
                <tr><td>*</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>It was both a long ceremony and very tedious.</td><td>The ceremony was both long and tedious.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>A time not for words but action.</td><td>A time not for words but for action.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Either you must grant his request or incur his ill will.</td><td>You must either grant his request or incur his ill will.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>My objections are, first, the injustice of the measure; second, that is unconstitutional. </td><td></td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>It may be asked, what if you need to express a rather large number of similar ideas — say, twenty? Must you write twenty consecutive sentences of the same pattern? On closer examination, you will probably find that the difficulty is imaginary — that these twenty ideas can be classified in groups, and that you need apply the principle only within each group. Otherwise, it is best to avoid the difficulty by putting statements in the form of a table.</p>
