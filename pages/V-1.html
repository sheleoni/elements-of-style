            Place yourself in the background

            <p>
            Write in a way that draws the reader's attention to the sense and substance of the writing,
            rather than to the mood and temper of the author. If the writing is solid and good, the mood
            and temper of the writer will eventually be revealed and not at the expense of the work.
            Therefore, the first piece of advice is this: to achieve style, begin by affecting none — that
            is, place yourself in the background. 
            
            </p>
            
            <p>A careful and honest writer does not need to worry
            about style. As you become proficient in the use of language, your style will emerge,
            because you yourself will emerge, and when this happens you will find it increasingly easy
            to break through the barriers that separate you from other minds, other hearts — which is,
            of course, the purpose of writing, as well as its principal reward. Fortunately, the act of
            composition, or creation, disciplines the mind; writing is one way to go about thinking, and
            the practice and habit of writing not only drain the mind but supply it, too.
