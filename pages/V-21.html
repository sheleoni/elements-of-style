            Prefer the standard to the offbeat

                Young writers will be drawn at every turn toward eccentricities in language. They will hear the beat of new vocabularies, the exciting rhythms of special segments of their society, each speaking a language of its own. All of us come under the spell of these unsettling drums; the problem for beginners is to listen to them, learn the words, feel the vibrations, and not be carried away.

                Youths invariably speak to other youths in a tongue of their own devising: 
                they renovate the language with a wild vigor, as they would a basement apartment. 
                By the time this paragraph sees print, <i>psyched, nerd, ripoff, dude, geek,</i> and <i>funky</i> will be the words of yesteryear, 
                and we will be fielding more recent ones that have come bouncing into our speech — some of them into our dictionary as well. 
                A new word is always up for survival. Many do survive. Others grow stale and disappear. Most are, at least in their infancy, 
                more appropriate to conversation than to composition.

                Today, the language of advertising enjoys an enormous circulation. 
                With its deliberate infractions of grammatical rules and its crossbreeding of the parts of speech, 
                it profoundly influences the tongues and pens of children and adults. 
                Your new kitchen range is so revolutionary it <i>obsoletes</i> all other ranges. 
                Your counter top is beautiful because it is <i>accessorized</i> with gold-plated faucets. 
                Your cigarette tastes good <i>like</i> a cigarette should. And, <i>like the man says,</i> you will want to try one. 
                You will also, in all probability, want to try writing that way, using that language. You do so at your peril, 
                for it is the language of mutilation.

            </p>

            <p>
                Advertisers are quite understandably interested in what they call "attention getting." 
                The man photographed must have lost an eye or grown a pink beard, or he must have three arms or be sitting wrong-end-to on a horse. 
                This technique is proper in its place, which is the world of selling, but the young writer had best not adopt the device of mutilation in ordinary composition, 
                whose purpose is to engage, not paralyze, the readers senses. Buy the gold-plated faucets if you will, 
                but do not accessorize your prose. To use the language well, do not begin by hacking it to bits; accept the whole body of it, 
                cherish its classic form, its variety, and its richness.

            </p>

                Another segment of society that has constructed a language of its own is business. 
                People in business say that toner cartridges are <i>in short supply, </i>
                that they have <i>updated</i> the next shipment of these cartridges, 
                and that they will <i>finalize</i> their recommendations at the next meeting of the board. 
                They are speaking a language familiar and dear to them. 
                Its portentous nouns and verbs invest ordinary events with high adventure; executives walk among toner cartridges, 
                caparisoned like knights. We should tolerate them — every person of spirit wants to ride a white horse. 
                The only question is whether business vocabulary is helpful to ordinary prose. 
                Usually, the same ideas can be expressed less formidably, if one makes the effort. 
                A good many of the special words of business seem designed more to express the user's dreams than to express a precise meaning. 
                Not all such words, of course, can be dismissed summarily; 
                indeed, no word in the language can be dismissed offhand by anyone who has a healthy curiosity. 
                <i>Update</i> isn't a bad word; in the right setting it is useful. In the wrong setting, though, it is destructive, 
                and the trouble with adopting coinages too quickly is that they will bedevil one by insinuating themselves where they do not belong. 
                This may sound like rhetorical snobbery, or plain stuffiness; but you will discover, in the course of your work, 
                that the setting of a word is just as restrictive as the setting of a jewel. The general rule here is to prefer the standard. 
                <i>Finalize</i>, for instance, is not standard; it is special, and it is a peculiarly fuzzy and silly word. 
                Does it mean "terminate," or does it mean "put into final form"? One can't be sure, really, what it means, 
                and one gets the impression that the person using it doesn't know, either, and doesn't want to know.

                The special vocabularies of the law, of the military, of government are familiar to most of us. Even the world of criticism has a modest pouch of private words <i>(luminous, taut)</i>, whose only virtue is that they are exceptionally nimble and can escape from the garden of meaning over the wall. Of these critical words, Wolcott Gibbs once wrote, "... they are detached from the language and inflated like little balloons." The young writer should learn to spot them — words that at first glance seem freighted with delicious meaning but that soon burst in air, leaving nothing but a memory of bright sound.

                The language is perpetually in flux: it is a living stream, shifting, changing, receiving new strength from a thousand tributaries, losing old forms in the backwaters of time. To suggest that a young writer not swim in the main stream of this turbulence would be foolish indeed, and such is not the intent of these cautionary remarks. The intent is to suggest that in choosing between the formal and the informal, the regular and the offbeat, the general and the special, the orthodox and the heretical, the beginner err on the side of conservatism, on the side of established usage. No idiom is taboo, no accent forbidden; there is simply a better chance of doing well if the writer holds a steady course, enters the stream of English quietly, and does not thrash about.

                "But," you may ask, "what if it comes natural to me to experiment rather than conform? What if I am a pioneer, or even a genius?" Answer: then be one. But do not forget that what may seem like pioneering may be merely evasion, or laziness — the disinclination to submit to discipline. Writing good standard English is no cinch, and before you have managed it you will have encountered enough rough country to satisfy even the most adventurous spirit.

                Style takes its final shape more from attitudes of mind than from principles of composition, for, as an elderly practitioner once remarked, "Writing is an act of faith, not a trick of grammar." This moral observation would have no place in a rule book were it not that style is the writer, and therefore what you are, rather than what you know, will at last determine your style. If you write, you must believe — in the truth and worth of the scrawl, in the ability of the reader to receive and decode the message. No one can write decently who is distrustful of the reader's intelligence, or whose attitude is patronizing.

                Many references have been made in this book to "the reader," who has been much in the news. It is now necessary to warn you that your concern for the reader must be pure: you must sympathize with the reader's plight (most readers are in trouble about half the time) but never seek to know the reader's wants. Your whole duty as a writer is to please and satisfy yourself, and the true writer always plays to an audience of one. Start sniffing the air, or glancing at the Trend Machine, and you are as good as dead, although you may make a nice living.
            </p>

            <p>
                Full of belief, sustained and elevated by the power of purpose, armed with the rules of grammar, you are ready for exposure. At this point, you may well pattern yourself on the fully exposed cow of Robert Louis Stevenson's rhyme. This friendly and commendable animal, you may recall, was "blown by all the winds that pass /And wet with all the showers." And so must you as a young writer be. In our modern idiom, we would say that you must get wet all over. Mr. Stevenson, working in a plainer style, said it with felicity, and suddenly one cow, out of so many, received the gift of immortality. Like the steadfast writer, she is at home in the wind and the rain; and, thanks to one moment of felicity, she will live on and on and on.
