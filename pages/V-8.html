                <i>Rather, very, little, pretty</i> — these are the leeches that infest the pond of prose, sucking
                the blood of words. 
                The constant use of the adjective <i>little</i> (except to indicate size) is particularly debilitating; 
                we should all try to do a little better, we should all be very watchful of this rule, for it is a rather important one, 
                and we are pretty sure to violate it now and then.
