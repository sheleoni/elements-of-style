            The number of the subject determines the number of the verb

            <p>Words that intervene between subject and verb do not affect the number of the verb.</p>

            <table><tr><td>*</td><td></td></tr>
            <tr><td>The bittersweet flavor of youth — its trials, its joys, its adventures, its challenges — are not soon forgotten.</td>
            <td>The bittersweet flavor of youth — its trials, its joys, its adventures, its challenges — is not soon forgotten.</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>A common blunder is the use of a singular verb form in a relative clause following "one of..." or a similar expression when the relative is the subject.</p>

            <table><tr><td>*</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>One of the ablest scientists who has attacked this problem</td>
                <td>One of the ablest scientists who have attacked this problem</td></tr>

                <tr><td>
                    One of those people who is never ready on time
                </td>
                <td>
                    One of those people who are never ready on time
                </td></tr>
                </table>

            <p>Use a singular verb form after <i>each, either, everyone, everybody, neither, nobody, someone.</i></p>

            <p><b>Everybody thinks he has a unique sense of humor.
            </b>

            <p><b>Although both clocks strike cheerfully, neither keeps good time.</b></p>

            <p>With <i>none</i>, use the singular verb when the word means "no one" or "not one."</p>

            <p><b>None of us are perfect.</b></p>
            <p><b>None of us is perfect.</b></p>

            <p>A plural verb is commonly used when none suggests more than one thing or person.</p>

            <p><b>None are so fallible as those who are sure they're right.</b></p>

            <p>A compound subject formed of two or more nouns joined by and almost always requires a plural verb.
            </p>

            <p><b>The walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand.</b></p>

            <p>But certain compounds, often cliches, are so inseparable they are considered a unit and so take a singular verb, as do compound subjects qualified by <i>each</i> or <i>every</i>.</p>

            <p><b>The long and the short of it is...</b></p>
            <p><b>Bread and butter was all she served.</b></p>
            <p><b>Give and take is essential to a happy household.</b></p>
            <p><b>Every window, picture, and mirror was smashed.</b></p>

            <p>A singular subject remains singular even if other nouns are connected to it by <i>with, as well as, in addition to, except, together with,</i> and <i>no less than.</i></p>
            <p><b>His speech as well as his manner is objectionable.</b></p>

            <p>A linking verb agrees with the number of its subject.</p>

            <p><b>What is wanted is a few more pairs of hands.</b></p>
            <p><b>The trouble with truth is its many varieties.</b></p>

            <p>Some nouns that appear to be plural are usually construed as singular and given a singular verb.
            </p>


            <p><b>
                Politics is an art, not a science.
                </b></p>
            <p><b>The Republican Headquarters is on this side of the tracks.</b></p>

            <p>But</p>

            <p><b>The general's quarters are across the river.</b></p>

            <p>In these cases the writer must simply learn the idioms. The contents of a book is singular. The contents of a jar may be either singular or plural, depending on what's in the jar — jam or marbles.</p>
