                Write in a way that comes easily and naturally to you, using words and phrases that come
                readily to hand. But do not assume that because you have acted naturally your product is
                without flaw.

                The use of language begins with imitation. The infant imitates the sounds made by its
                parents; the child imitates first the spoken language, then the stuff of books. The imitative
                life continues long after the writer is secure in the language, for it is almost impossible to
                avoid imitating what one admires. Never imitate consciously, but do not worry about being
                an imitator; take pains instead to admire what is good. Then when you write in a way that
                comes naturally, you will echo the halloos that bear repeating.
