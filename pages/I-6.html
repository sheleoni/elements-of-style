            <p>In other words, do not use periods for commas.</p>
            <p><b>I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago. Coming home from Liverpool to New York.</b></p>
            <p><b>He was an interesting talker. A man who had traveled all over the world and lived in half a dozen countries.</b></p>
            <p>In both these examples, the first period should be replaced by a comma, and the following word begun with a small letter.</p>
            <p>It is permissible to make an emphatic word or expression serve the purpose of a sentence and to punctuate it accordingly.</p>
            <p><b>Again and again he called out. No reply.</b></p>
            <p>The writer must, however, be certain that the emphasis is warranted, and that he will not be suspected of a mere blunder in punctuation.</p>
            <p>Rules 3, 4, 5, and 6 cover the most important principles in the punctuation of ordinary sentences; they should be so thoroughly mastered that their application becomes second nature.</p>
