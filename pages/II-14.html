            Use the active voice

        <div class="body-text">
        

            <p>The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive:</p>

            <p><b>I shall always remember my first visit to Boston.</b></p>

            <p>This is much better than</p>


            <p><b> My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.</b></p>

            <p>The latter sentence is less direct, less bold, and less concise. If the writer tries to make it more concise by omitting "by me,"</p>


            <p><b>My first visit to Boston will always be remembered,</b></p>
            

            <p>it becomes indefinite: is it the writer or some undisclosed person or the world at large that will always remember this visit?</p>
            <p>This rule does not, of course, mean that the writer should entirely discard the passive voice, which is frequently convenient and sometimes necessary.
            </p>

            <p><b>The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed today.</b></p>
            <p><b>Modern readers have little esteem for the dramatists of the Restoration.</b></p>

            <p>The first would be the preferred form in a paragraph on the dramatists of the Restoration, 
                the second in a paragraph on the tastes of modern readers. The need to make a particular word the subject of the sentence will often, as in these examples, determine which voice is to be used.</p>

            <p>The habitual use of the active voice, however, makes for forcible writing. 
                This is true not only in narrative concerned principally with action but in writing of any kind. 
                Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made lively and emphatic by substituting a transitive 
                in the active voice for some such perfunctory expression as <i>there is</i> or could be <i>heard</i>.</p>

            
            <table><tr><td>*</td><td></td></tr>
            <tr><td>
                There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground.
            </td><td>
                Dead leaves covered the ground.
            </td></tr>
            <tr><td>At dawn the crowing of a rooster could be heard.</td>
            <td>The cock's crow came with dawn.</td></tr>


            <tr><td>
                The reason he left college was that his health became impaired.
                </td>
            <td>Failing health compelled him to leave college.</td></tr>
        
            <tr><td>It was not long before she was very sorry that she had said what she had.</td>
            <td>She soon repented her words.</td></tr>

            <p>Note, in the examples above, that when a sentence is made stronger, it usually becomes shorter. Thus, brevity is a by-product of vigor.
