                Revising is part of writing. Few writers are so expert that they can produce what they are after on the first try. 
                Quite often you will discover, on examining the completed work, that there are serious flaws in the arrangement of the material, calling for transpositions. 
                When this is the case, a word processor can save you time and labor as you rearrange the manuscript. 
                You can select material on your screen and move it to a more appropriate spot, or, if you cannot find the right spot, you can move the material to the end of the manuscript until you decide whether to delete it. 
                Some writers find that working with a printed copy of the manuscript helps them to visualize the process of change; others prefer to revise entirely on screen.

             Above all, do not be afraid to experiment with what you have written. Save both the original and the revised versions; you can always use the computer to restore the manuscript to its original condition, should that course seem best. Remember, it is no sign of weakness or defeat that your manuscript ends up in need of major surgery. This is a common occurrence in all writing, and among the best writers.
