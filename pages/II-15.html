            <p>Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, noncommittal language. Use the word not as a means of denial or in antithesis, never as a means of evasion.

                        She did not think that studying Latin was a sensible way to use one's time.</td><td>She thought the study of Latin a waste of time./td></tr>
                    <tr><td>

                        <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> is rather weak in spots. Shakespeare does not portray Katharine as a very admirable character, nor does Bianca remain long in memory as an important character in Shakespeare's works.

                    </td>
                    <td>

                        The women in <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> are unattractive. Katharine is disagreeable, Bianca insignificant.
                    </td></tr>
                </table>


                <p>The last example, before correction, is indefinite as well as negative. The corrected version, consequently, is simply a guess at the writer's intention.</p>

                <p>All three examples show the weakness inherent in the word <i>not</i>. Consciously or unconsciously, the reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not; the reader wishes to be told what is. Hence, as a rule, it is better to express even a negative in positive form.</p>

                <table>
                    <tr><td>*</td><td></td></tr>
                    <tr><td>not honest</td><td>dishonest</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>not important</td><td>trifling</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>did not remember</td><td>forgot</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>did not pay any attention to</td><td>ignored</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>did not have much confidence in</td><td>distrusted</td></tr>
                </table>

                <p>Placing negative and positive in opposition makes for a stronger structure.</p>

                <p><b>Not charity, but simple justice.</b></p>
                <p><b>Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.</b></p>
                <p><b>Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.</b></p>

                <p>Negative words other than <i>not</i> are usually strong.</p>

                <p><b>Her loveliness I never knew / Until she smiled on me.</b></p>

                <p>Statements qualified with unnecessary auxiliaries or conditionals sound irresolute.</p>

                <table>
                    <tr><td>*</td><td></td></tr>
                    <tr><td>
                        If you would let us know the time of your arrival, we would be happy to arrange your transportation from the airport.
                    </td><td>
                        If you will let us know the time of your arrival, we shall be happy to arrange your transportation from the airport.

                    </td></tr>

                        Applicants can make a good impression by being neat and punctual.

                        Applicants will make a good impression if they are neat and punctual.

                    <tr><td>
                        Plath may be ranked among those modem poets who died young.
                    </td><td>
                        Plath was one of those modern poets who died young.

                </table>

            </p>
            <p>If your every sentence admits a doubt, your writing will lack authority. 
                Save the auxiliaries <i>would, should, could, may, might, </i>and <i>can</i> for situations involving real uncertainty.
