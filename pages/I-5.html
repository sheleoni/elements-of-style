               Do not join independent clauses by a comma
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
             <p>If two or more clauses, grammatically complete and not joined by a conjunction, are to form a single compound sentence, the proper mark of punctuation is a semicolon.</p>
            <p><b>Stevenson&apos;s romances are entertaining; they are full of exciting adventures.</b></p>
            <p><b>It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark.</b></p>
            <p>It is of course equally correct to write the above as two sentences each, replacing the semicolons by periods.</p>
            <p><b>Stevenson&apos;s romances are entertaining. They are full of exciting adventures.</b></p>
            <p><b>It is nearly half past five. We cannot reach town before dark.</b></p>
            <p>If a conjunction is inserted, the proper mark is a comma (Rule 4).</p>
            <p><b>Steven&apos;s romances are entertaining, for they are full of exciting adventures.</b></p>
            <p><b>It is nearly half past five, and we cannot reach town before dark.</b></p>
            <p>Note that if the second clause is preceded by an adverb, such as <em>accordingly, besides, so, then, therefore,&nbsp;</em> or <em>thus,</em>
            and not by a conjunction, the semicolon is still required.</em></p>

            <p><b>I had never been in the place before; so I had difficulty in finding my way about.</b></p>
            <p>In general, however, it is best, in writing, to avoid using <em>so</em> in this manner;
            there is danger that the writer who uses it at all may use it too often. A simple correction, usually serviceable, is to omit the 
        word <em>so</em>, and begin the first clause with <em>as</em>:</p>

            <p><b>As I had never been in the place before, I had difficulty in finding my way about.</b></p>

            <p>If the clauses are very short, and are alike in form, a comma is usually permissible:</p>
            <p><b>Man proposes, God disposes.</b></p>
            <p><b>The gate swung apart, the bridge fell, the portcullis was drawn up.</b></p>
