            <p><b><font color="black">Many of the words and expressions listed here are not so much bad English as bad style,
                the commonplaces of careless writing. As illustrated under <i>Feature</i>, the proper correction
                is likely to be not the replacement of one word or set of words by another but the
                replacement of vague generality by definite statement.
                The shape of our language is not rigid; in questions of usage we have no lawgiver whose
                word is final. Students whose curiosity is aroused by the interpretations that follow, or
                whose doubts are raised, will wish to pursue their investigations further. Books useful in
                such pursuits are 
                <i>Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary,</i> Tenth Edition; 
                <i>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,</i> Third Edition; 
                <i>Webster's Third New International Dictionary</i>; 
                <i>The New Fowler's Modern English Usage,</i> Third Edition, edited by R. W. Burchfield; 
                <i>Modern American Usage: A Guide</i> by Wilson Follett and Erik Wensberg;
                and <i>The Careful Writer</i> by Theodore M. Bernstein. </font></b></p>

            <p><b>Aggravate. Irritate. <font color="black">The first means "to add to" an already troublesome or vexing matter or
                condition. The second means "to vex" or "to annoy" or "to chafe."</font></b></p>
            
            <p><b>All right.<font color="black">Idiomatic in familiar speech as a detached phrase in the sense "Agreed," or "Go
                ahead," or "O.K." Properly written as two words — <i>all right</i>. </font></b></p>

            <p><b>Allude.<font color="black">Do not confuse with <i>elude.</i> You allude to a book; you <i>elude</i> a pursuer. Note, too, 
                that <i>allude</i> is not synonymous with <i>refer</i>. An allusion is an indirect mention, a reference is a specific one. </font></b></p>
            
            <p><b>Allusion.<font color="black">Easily confused with <i>illusion.</i> 
                The first means "an indirect reference"; 
                the second means "an unreal image" or "a false impression." </font></b></p>


            <p><b>Alternate. Alternative.<font color="black">
                The words are not always interchangeable as nouns or adjectives.
                The first means every other one in a series; the second, one of two possibilities. As the
                other one of a series of two, an <i>alternate</i> may stand for "a substitute," but an <i>alternative,</i>
                although used in a similar sense, connotes a matter of choice that is never present with <i>alternate</i>.
            </font></b></p>

            <p><b>As the flooded road left them no alternative, they took the alternate route. </b></p>



            <p><b>Among. Between.<font color="black">
                When more than two things or persons are involved, <i>among</i> is usually called for: 
                "The money was divided among the four players." When, however, 
                more than two are involved but each is considered individually, <i>between</i> is preferred: "an agreement
                between the six heirs."
            </font></b></p>


            <p><b>And/or.<font color="black"> A device, or shortcut, that damages a sentence and often leads to confusion or ambiguity. </font></b></p>

                <table>
                    <tr><td>*</td><td></td></tr>
                    <tr><td>First of all, would an honor system
                        successfully cut down on the amount of
                        stealing and/or cheating?</td>
                        <td>First of all, would an honor system reduce
                            the incidence of stealing or cheating or
                            both?</td></tr>
                </table>

            <p><b>Anticipate.<font color="black">Use <i>expect</i> in the sense of simple expectation. </font></b></p>

            </table>

            <p><b>In the second example, the word <i>anticipated</i> is ambiguous. It could mean simply that the
                brother believed the upturn would occur, or it could mean that he acted in advance of the
                expected upturn — by buying stock, perhaps. </b></p>


            <p><b>Anybody.<font color="black">In the sense of "any person," not to be written as two words. <i>Any body</i> means
                "any corpse," or "any human form," or "any group." The rule holds equally for <i>everybody,</i>
                <i>nobody,</i> and <i>somebody.</i> </font></b></p>

            <p><b>Anyone.<font color="black">In the sense of "anybody," written as one word. <i>Any one</i> means "any single
                person" or "any single thing." </font></b></p>

  
            <p><b>As good or better than.<font color="black">
                Expression of this type should be corrected by rearranging the sentences.
            </font></b></p>

            <p><b><font color="black">The chief exception is at the beginning of a sentence, where <i>yet</i> means something different.</font></b></p>

            <p><b>As yet (<i>or</i> so far) he has not succeeded.</b></p>

            </table></p>

            <p><b><font family="black">The too-frequent use of <i>but</i> as a conjunction leads to the fault discussed under Rule 18. A
                loose sentence formed with <i>but</i> can usually be converted into a periodic sentence formed with <i>although</i>. </font></b></p>
            <p><b><font family="black">Particularly awkward is one <i>but</i> closely following another, thus making a contrast to a
                contrast, or a reservation to a reservation. This is easily corrected by rearrangement.</font></b></p>

            <p><b>Care less.<font color="black"> The dismissive "I couldn't care less" is often used with the shortened "not"
                mistakenly (and mysteriously) omitted: "I could care less." The error destroys the meaning
                of the sentence and is careless indeed. </font></b></p>

            <p><b>Claim. (verb).<font color="black"> 
                With object-noun, means "lay claim to." May be used with a dependent
                clause if this sense is clearly intended: "She claimed that she was the sole heir." (But even
                here <i>claimed to be</i> would be better.) Not to be used as a substitute for <i>declare, maintain,</i> or <i>charge</i>.

            <p><b>Clever.<font color="black"> Note that the word means one thing when applied to people, another when applied
                to horses. A clever horse is a good-natured one, not an ingenious one. </font></b></p>

            <p><b>Compare.<font color="black"> To <i>compare to</i> is to point out or imply resemblances between objects regarded
                as essentially of a different order; to <i>compare with</i> is mainly to point out differences between objects regarded as essentially of the same order. 
                Thus, life has been <i>compare to</i> a pilgrimage, <i>to</i> a drama, <i>to</i> a battle; Congress may be <i>compared with</i> the British
                Parliament. Paris has been <i>compared to</i> ancient Athens; it may be <i>compared with</i> modern London. </font></b></p>

            <p><b>Comprise.<font color="black"> Literally, "embrace": A zoo comprises mammals, reptiles, and birds (because it
                "embraces," or "includes," them). But animals do not comprise ("embrace") a zoo — they
                constitute a zoo. </font></b></p>

            <p><b>Consider.<font color="black"> Not followed by <i>as</i>> when it means "believe to be."</font></b></p>

            <p><b><font color="black">When <i>considered</i> means "examined" or "discussed", it is followed by <i>as:</i></font></b></p>

            <p><b>The lecturer considered Eisenhower first as soldier and second as administrator.</b></p>

            <p><b>Contact.<font color="black"> As a transitive verb, the word is vague and self-important. Do not <i>contact</i>> people;
                get in touch with them, look them up, phone them, find them, or meet them.</font></b></p>

            <p><b>Cope.<font color="black"> An intransitive verb used with <i>with.</i> In formal writing, one does not "cope," one "copes with" something or somebody.</font></b></p>

            <p><b>Currently.<font color="black">  In the sense of <i>now</i> with a verb in the present tense, <i>currently</i> is usually
                redundant; emphasis is better achieved through a more precise reference to time. </font></b></p>

            <p><b>Different than.<font color="black"> Here logic supports established usage: one thing differs <i>from</i> another, hence, <i>different from</i>. 
            Or, <i>other than, unlike.</i></font></b></p>

            <p><b>Disinterested.<font color="black"> Means "impartial". Do not confuse it with <i>uninterested</i>, which means "not interested in."</font></b></p>

            <p><b>Divided into.<font color="black">
                Not to be misused for <i>composed of.</i> The line is sometimes difficult to draw;
                doubtless plays are divided into acts, but poems are composed of stanzas. An apple,
                halved, is divided into sections, but an apple is composed of seeds, flesh, and skin.

            <p><b>Effect.<font color="black">As a noun, means "result"; as a verb, means "to bring about," "to accomplish" (not
                to be confused with <i>affect</i>, which means "to influence"). </font></b></p>

            <p><font color="black">As a noun, often loosely used in perfunctory writing about fashions, music, painting, and
                other arts: "a Southwestern effect"; "effects in pale green"; "very delicate effects"; "subtle
                effects"; "a charming effect was produced." The writer who has a definite meaning to

                The phrase is equivalent to <i>and the rest, and so forth,</i> and hence is not to be used if one of
                these would be insufficient — that is, if the reader would be left in doubt as to any
                important particulars. Least open to objection when it represents the last terms of a list
                already given almost in full, or immaterial words at the end of a quotation. </font></b></p>

            <p><b><font color="black">At the end of a list introduced by <i>such as, for example,</i> or any similar expression, <i>etc.</i> is
                incorrect. In formal writing, <i>etc.</i> is a misfit. An item important enough to call for <i>etc.</i> is

            <p><b>Fact.<font color="black"> Use this word only of matters capable of direct verification, not of matters of

                modern generals or that the climate of California is delightful, however defensible they may
                be, are not properly called facts. </font></b></p>

                The use of <i>like</i> for as has its defenders; they argue that any usage that achieves currency

                isn't. An expression sometimes merely enjoys a vogue, much as an article of apparel does.
                <i>Like</i> has long been widely misused by the illiterate; lately it has been taken up by the 
                knowing and the well- informed, who find it catchy, or liberating, and who use it as though
                they were slumming. If every word or device that achieved currency were immediately
                authenticated, simply on the ground of popularity, the language would be as chaotic as a
                ball game with no foul lines. For the student, perhaps the most useful thing to know about
                <i>like</i> is that most carefully edited publications regard its use before phrases and clauses as

                A similar fault is the use of the plural pronoun with the antecedent anybody, somebody,
                someone, the intention being either to avoid the awkward he or she or to avoid committing
                oneself to one or the other. Some bashful speakers even say, "A friend of mine told me
                that they...." 
            
                <p>The use of he as a pronoun for nouns embracing both genders is a simple, practical
                convention rooted in the beginnings of the English language. Currently, however, many

                offensive. Substituting he or she in its place is the logical thing to do if it works. But it often
                doesn't work, if only because repetition makes it sound boring or silly.

            <p><b>Verbal.<font color="black"> Sometimes means "word for word" and in this sense may refer to something

            <p><b>While.<font color="black"> Avoid the indiscriminate use of this word for <i>and, but,</i> and <i>although.</i> Many writers
                use it frequently as a substitute for <i>and</i> or <i>but,</i> either from a mere desire to vary the
                connective or from doubt about which of the two connectives is more appropriate. In this
                use it is best replaced by a semicolon. </font></b></p>

                There is not a noun in the language to which <i>-wise</i> cannot be added if the spirit moves one
