           In summaries, keep to one tense</div>
        <div class="body-text">

            <p>In summarizing the action of a drama, use the present tense.
                In summarizing a poem, story or novel, also use the present, 
                though you may use the past if it seems more natural to do so.

                If the summary is in the present tense, antecedent action should be expressed by the perfect;
                if in the past, by the past perfect.

            </p>

            <p><b>Chance prevents Friar John from delivering Friar Lawrence's letter to Romeo.
                Meanwhile, owing to her father's arbitrary change of the day set for her wedding,
                Juliet has been compelled to drink the potion on Tuesday night,
                with the result that Balthasar informs Romeo of her supposed death before Friar Lawrence learns the nondelivery of the letter.
            </b></p>

            <p>But whichever tense is used in the sumamry, a past tense in direct discourse or in direct question remains unchanged.</p> 
            <p><b>The Friar confesses that it was he who married them.</b></p>

            <p>Apart from the exceptions noted, the writer should use the same tense throughout.
                Shifting from one tense to another gives the appearance of uncertainty and irresolution.
            </p>

            <p>In presenting the statements of the thought of someone else, as in summarizing an essay or reporting a speech,
                do not overwork such expressions as "he said," "she stated," "the speaker added," "the speaker then went on to say," "the author also thinks."
                <strong>Indicate clearly at the outset, once for all, that what follows is summary, and then waste no words in repeating the notification.</strong>

            </p>
            <p>In notebooks, in newspapers, in handbooks of literature, summaries of one kind or another may be indispensable,
                and for children in primary schools retelling a story in their own word is useful exercise.

                But in the criticism or interpretation of literature, be careful to avoid dropping into summary.
                It may be necessary to devote one or two sentences to indicating the subject, or the opening situation,
                of the work being discussed, or to cite numerous details to illustrate its qualities. 
                But you should aim at writing an orderly discussion supported by evidence, not a summary with occasional comment.
                
                Similarly, if the scope of the discussion includes a number of works, as a rule it is better not to take them up singly in chronological order
                but to aim from the beginning at establishing general conclusions.
