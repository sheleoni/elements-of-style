            <p>Write with nouns and verbs, not with adjectives and adverbs. The adjective hasn't been built that can pull a weak or inaccurate noun out of a tight place.

            <p><b>Up the airy mountain,</b></p>

            <p><b>We daren't go a-hunting</b></p>
            <p><b>For fear of little men...</b></p>

            <p>The nouns <i>mountain</i> and <i>glen</i> are accurate enough, but had the mountain not become airy, the glen rushy, William Ailing-ham might never have got off the ground with his poem. In general, however, it is nouns and verbs, not their assistants, that give good writing its toughness and color.</p>
