        <br><div class="chapter-subtitle">
            A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject

        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
        
            <p><b>Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two children.
            </b></p>

            <p>The word <i>walking</i> refers to the subject of the sentence, not to the woman.
                To make it refer to the woman, the writer must recast the sentence.</p>
            
            <p><b>He saw a woman, accompanied by two children, walking slowly down the road.
            </b></p>

            <p>Participial phrases preceded by a conjunction or by a preposition, nouns in apposition, adjectives, and adjective phrases come under the same rule if they begin the sentence.</p>

            <table>
                <tr><td>*</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>On arriving in Chicago, his friends met him at the station.</td>
                    <td>On arriving in Chicago, he was met at the station by his friends.
                    </td></tr>
                <tr><td>A soldier of proved valor, they entrusted him with the defense of the city.</td>
                    <td>A soldier of proved valor, he was entrusted with the defense of the city.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Young and inexperienced, the task seemed easy to me.
                </td><td>Young and inexperienced, I thought the task easy.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Without a friend to counsel him, the temptation proved irresistible.</td>
                    <td>Without a friend to counsel him, he found the temptation irresistible.</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>Sentences violating Rule 11 are often ludicrous:</p>

            <p><b>Being in a dilapidated condition, I was able to buy the house very cheap.</b></p>
            <p><b>Wondering irresolutely what to do next, the clock struck twelve.</b></p>
