            Place a comma before <i> and </i>or <i>but</i> introducing an independent clause

            <p><b>The early records of the city have disappeared, and the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.</b></p>

            <p><b>The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape.</b>

            <p>Sentence of this type, isolated from their context, may seem to be in need of rewriting. 
                As they make complete sense when the comma is reached, the second clause has the appearance of an afterthought.

                Further, <i>and</i> is the least specific of connectives. Used between independent clauses, it indicates only that a relation exists
                between them without defining that relation. In the example above, the relation is that of cause and result. The two sentences might be rewritten:
            </p> 

            <p><b>As the early records of the city have disappeared, the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.</b></p>
            <p><b>Although the situation is perilous, there is still one chance of escape.</b></p>

            <p>Or the subordinate clausese might be replaced by phrases:</p> 

            <p><b>Owing to the disappearance of the early records of the city, the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.</b></p>
            <p><b>In this perilous situation, there is still one chance of escape.</b></p>

            <p>But a writer may err by making his sentence too uniformly compact and periodic, and an occasional loose sentence prevents
                the style from becoming too formal and gives the reader a certain relief.
                Consequently, loose sentences of the type first quoted are common in easy, unstudied writing.
                 But a writer should be careful not to construct too many of his sentences after this pattern (see Rule 14).
            </p>


            <p>Two-part senteces of which the second member is introduced by <i>as</i> (in the sentence of <i>because</i>), <i>for, or, nor</i> and <i>while</i>
             (in the sense of <i>and at the same time</i>) likewise require a comma before the conjunction.</p>
      
            <p>If a dependent clause, or an introductory phrase requiring to be set off by a comma, precedes the second independent clause,
                 no comma is needed after the conjunction.
            </p>

            <p><i>The situation is perilous, but if we are prepared to act promptly, there is still one chance of escape.</i></p>

            <p>For two-part sentences connected by an adverb, see the next section.</p>
